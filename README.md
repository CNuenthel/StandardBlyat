# StandardBlyat

This script compares flea market items with vendor sale prices. If items are found to have numerous flea sale prices less than a vendor sale price, those items are aggregated and compared to determinee profitability. The flea market moves fast, so this is not a gaurantee that the item is still present, but generally points towards higher volume "discount" items as the Delta increases. 

Currently I have this just to review "Valuables" as categorized in Tarkov. I've currently had more success with timeliness on items with Deltas approaching ~3000
