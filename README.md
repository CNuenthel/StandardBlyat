# StandardBlyat

Currently I have this just to review "Valuables" as categorized in Tarkov. This file currently just compares vendor prices and flea market below-vendor-price averages for potentially flippable items
on the flea market. I've currently had more success with timeliness on items with Deltas approaching ~3000
